A representation of OCL expressions in Java.

**Paper**: "Proving correctness for SQL implementations of OCL constraints"

This submodule performs parsing from OCL expressions to Java object hierarchy. 
Given a datamodel (in JSON format) and an OCL expression, **JavaOCL** generates a Java object representation of this expression.

**Note**: For the usage of this paper, this implementation will be exported to a JAR file and included as a submodule. Although it can operate as a standalone software, its functionality will not be discussed in detail here since it is out of the manuscript scope. Interested readers can find the exported JAR file [here](https://github.com/oclsqlprover/JavaOCL/releases/tag/v1.0).
